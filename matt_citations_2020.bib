	abstract = {Objective: To develop and test a visual analytics tool to help clinicians identify systematic and clinically meaningful patterns in patient-generated data (PGD) while decreasing perceived information overload.
Methods: Participatory design was used to develop Glucolyzer, an interactive tool featuring hierarchical clustering and a heatmap visualization to help registered dietitians (RDs) identify associative patterns between blood glucose levels and per-meal macronutrient composition for individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Ten RDs participated in a within-subjects experiment to compare Glucolyzer to a static logbook format. For each representation, participants had 25 minutes to examine 1 month of diabetes self-monitoring data captured by an individual with T2DM and identify clinically meaningful patterns. We compared the quality and accuracy of the observations generated using each representation.
Results: Participants generated 50\% more observations when using Glucolyzer (98) than when using the logbook format (64) without any loss in accuracy (69\% accuracy vs 62\%, respectively, p = .17). Participants identified more observations that included ingredients other than carbohydrates using Glucolyzer (36\% vs 16\%, p = .027). Fewer RDs reported feelings of information overload using Glucolyzer compared to the logbook format. Study participants displayed variable acceptance of hierarchical clustering.
Conclusions: Visual analytics have the potential to mitigate provider concerns about the volume of self-monitoring data. Glucolyzer helped dietitians identify meaningful patterns in self-monitoring data without incurring perceived information overload. Future studies should assess whether similar tools can support clinicians in personalizing behavioral interventions that improve patient outcomes.},

	title = {Behavioral-clinical phenotyping with type 2 diabetes self-monitoring data},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08761},
	abstract = {Objective: To evaluate unsupervised clustering methods for identifying individual-level behavioral-clinical phenotypes that relate personal biomarkers and behavioral traits in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) self-monitoring data. Materials and Methods: We used hierarchical clustering (HC) to identify groups of meals with similar nutrition and glycemic impact for 6 individuals with T2DM who collected self-monitoring data. We evaluated clusters on: 1) correspondence to gold standards generated by certified diabetes educators (CDEs) for 3 participants; 2) face validity, rated by CDEs, and 3) impact on CDEs' ability to identify patterns for another 3 participants. Results: Gold standard (GS) included 9 patterns across 3 participants. Of these, all 9 were re-discovered using HC: 4 GS patterns were consistent with patterns identified by HC (over 50\% of meals in a cluster followed the pattern); another 5 were included as sub-groups in broader clusers. 50\% (9/18) of clusters were rated over 3 on 5-point Likert scale for validity, significance, and being actionable. After reviewing clusters, CDEs identified patterns that were more consistent with data (70\% reduction in contradictions between patterns and participants' records). Discussion: Hierarchical clustering of blood glucose and macronutrient consumption appears suitable for discovering behavioral-clinical phenotypes in T2DM. Most clusters corresponded to gold standard and were rated positively by CDEs for face validity. Cluster visualizations helped CDEs identify more robust patterns in nutrition and glycemic impact, creating new possibilities for visual analytic solutions. Conclusion: Machine learning methods can use diabetes self-monitoring data to create personalized behavioral-clinical phenotypes, which may prove useful for delivering personalized medicine.},

To move toward this goal, we used univariate and multivariate lagged regression models to investigate associations between twenty pairs of drug orders and laboratory measurements. Multivariate lagged regression models exhibited higher sensitivity and specificity than univariate lagged regression in the 20 examples, and incorporating autoregressive terms for labs and drugs produced more robust signals in cases of known associations among the 20 example pairings. Moreover, including inpatient admission terms in the model attenuated the signals for some cases of unlikely associations, demonstrating how multivariate lagged regression models' explicit handling of context-based variables can provide a simple way to probe for health-care processes that confound analyses of EHR data.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate how individuals with diabetes and diabetes educators reason about data collected through self-monitoring and to draw implications for the design of data-driven self-management technologies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten individuals with diabetes (six type 1 and four type 2) and 2 experienced diabetes educators were presented with a set of self-monitoring data captured by an individual with type 2 diabetes. The set included digital images of meals and their textual descriptions, and blood glucose (BG) readings captured before and after these meals. The participants were asked to review a set of meals and associated BG readings, explain differences in postprandial BG levels for these meals, and predict postprandial BG levels for the same individual for a different set of meals. Researchers compared conclusions and predictions reached by the participants with those arrived at by quantitative analysis of the collected data.
RESULTS: The participants used both macronutrient composition of meals, most notably the inclusion of carbohydrates, and names of dishes and ingredients to reason about changes in postprandial BG levels. Both individuals with diabetes and diabetes educators reported difficulties in generating predictions of postprandial BG; their predictions varied in their correlations with the actual captured readings from r = 0.008 to r = 0.75.
CONCLUSION: Overall, the study showed that identifying trends in the data collected with self-monitoring is a complex process, and that conclusions reached by both individuals with diabetes and diabetes educators are not always reliable. This suggests the need for new ways to facilitate individuals' reasoning with informatics interventions.},

	doi = {10.1093/jamia/ocy124},
	abstract = {Objective: To study the effect on patient cohorts of mapping condition (diagnosis) codes from source billing vocabularies to a clinical vocabulary.
Materials and Methods: Nine International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD9-CM) concept sets were extracted from eMERGE network phenotypes, translated to Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms concept sets, and applied to patient data that were mapped from source ICD9-CM and ICD10-CM codes to Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms codes using Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) vocabulary mappings. The original ICD9-CM concept set and a concept set extended to ICD10-CM were used to create patient cohorts that served as gold standards.
Results: Four phenotype concept sets were able to be translated to Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms without ambiguities and were able to perform perfectly with respect to the gold standards. The other 5 lost performance when 2 or more ICD9-CM or ICD10-CM codes mapped to the same Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms code. The patient cohorts had a total error (false positive and false negative) of up to 0.15\% compared to querying ICD9-CM source data and up to 0.26\% compared to querying ICD9-CM and ICD10-CM data. Knowledge engineering was required to produce that performance; simple automated methods to generate concept sets had errors up to 10\% (one outlier at 250\%).
Discussion: The translation of data from source vocabularies to Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) resulted in very small error rates that were an order of magnitude smaller than other error sources.
Conclusion: It appears possible to map diagnoses from disparate vocabularies to a single clinical vocabulary and carry out research using a single set of definitions, thus improving efficiency and transportability of research.},

At the heart of data assimilation is the mechanistic model, here an endocrine model. Such models can vary in complexity, contain testable hypotheses about important mechanics that govern the system (eg, nutrition's effect on glucose), and, as such, constrain the model space, allowing for accurate estimation using very little data.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jbi.2018.08.014},
	abstract = {We studied how lagged linear regression can be used to detect the physiologic effects of drugs from data in the electronic health record (EHR). We systematically examined the effect of methodological variations ((i) time series construction, (ii) temporal parameterization, (iii) intra-subject normalization, (iv) differencing (lagged rates of change achieved by taking differences between consecutive measurements), (v) explanatory variables, and (vi) regression models) on performance of lagged linear methods in this context. We generated two gold standards (one knowledge-base derived, one expert-curated) for expected pairwise relationships between 7 drugs and 4 labs, and evaluated how the 64 unique combinations of methodological perturbations reproduce the gold standards. Our 28 cohorts included patients in the Columbia University Medical Center/NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital clinical database, and ranged from 2820 to 79,514 patients with between 8 and 209 average time points per patient. The most accurate methods achieved AUROC of 0.794 for knowledge-base derived gold standard (95\%CI [0.741, 0.847]) and 0.705 for expert-curated gold standard (95\% CI [0.629, 0.781]). We observed a mean AUROC of 0.633 (95\%CI [0.610, 0.657], expert-curated gold standard) across all methods that re-parameterize time according to sequence and use either a joint autoregressive model with time-series differencing or an independent lag model without differencing. The complement of this set of methods achieved a mean AUROC close to 0.5, indicating the importance of these choices. We conclude that time-series analysis of EHR data will likely rely on some of the beneficial pre-processing and modeling methodologies identified, and will certainly benefit from continued careful analysis of methodological perturbations. This study found that methodological variations, such as pre-processing and representations, have a large effect on results, exposing the importance of thoroughly evaluating these components when comparing machine-learning methods.},

	abstract = {We evaluate the benefits of combining different offline and online data assimilation methodologies to improve personalized blood glucose prediction with type 2 diabetes self-monitoring data. We collect self-monitoring data (nutritional reports and pre- and post-prandial glucose measurements) from 4 individuals with diabetes and 2 individuals without diabetes. We write online to refer to methods that update state and parameters sequentially as nutrition and glucose data are received, and offline to refer to methods that estimate parameters over a fixed data set, distributed over a time window containing multiple nutrition and glucose measurements. We fit a model of ultradian glucose dynamics to the first half of each data set using offline (MCMC and nonlinear optimization) and online (unscented Kalman filter and an unfiltered model---a dynamical model driven by nutrition data that does not update states) data assimilation methods. Model parameters estimated over the first half of the data are used within online forecasting methods to issue forecasts over the second half of each data set. Offline data assimilation methods provided consistent advantages in predictive performance and practical usability in 4 of 6 patient data sets compared to online data assimilation methods alone; yet 2 of 6 patients were best predicted with a strictly online approach. Interestingly, parameter estimates generated offline led to worse predictions when fed to a stochastic filter than when used in a simple, unfiltered model that incorporates new nutritional information, but does not update model states based on glucose measurements. The relative improvements seen from the unfiltered model, when carefully trained offline, exposes challenges in model sensitivity and filtering applications, but also opens possibilities for improved glucose forecasting and relaxed patient self-monitoring requirements.},

We pilot-tested GlucOracle with two populations: members of an online diabetes community, knowledgeable about diabetes and technologically savvy; and individuals from a low socio-economic status community, characterized by high prevalence of diabetes, low literacy and limited experience with mobile apps. Individuals in both communities engaged with personal glucose forecasts and found them useful for adjusting immediate meal options, and planning future meals. However, the study raised new questions as to appropriate time, form, and focus of forecasts and suggested new research directions for personalized predictions in health.},

	abstract = {Type 2 diabetes leads to premature death and reduced quality of life for 8\% of Americans. Nutrition management is critical to maintaining glycemic control, yet it is difficult to achieve due to the high individual differences in glycemic response to nutrition. Anticipating glycemic impact of different meals can be challenging not only for individuals with diabetes, but also for expert diabetes educators. Personalized computational models that can accurately forecast an impact of a given meal on an individual's blood glucose levels can serve as the engine for a new generation of decision support tools for individuals with diabetes. However, to be useful in practice, these computational engines need to generate accurate forecasts based on limited datasets consistent with typical self-monitoring practices of individuals with type 2 diabetes. This paper uses three forecasting machines: (i) data assimilation, a technique borrowed from atmospheric physics and engineering that uses Bayesian modeling to infuse data with human knowledge represented in a mechanistic model, to generate real-time, personalized, adaptable glucose forecasts; (ii) model averaging of data assimilation output; and (iii) dynamical Gaussian process model regression. The proposed data assimilation machine, the primary focus of the paper, uses a modified dual unscented Kalman filter to estimate states and parameters, personalizing the mechanistic models. Model selection is used to make a personalized model selection for the individual and their measurement characteristics. The data assimilation forecasts are empirically evaluated against actual postprandial glucose measurements captured by individuals with type 2 diabetes, and against predictions generated by experienced diabetes educators after reviewing a set of historical nutritional records and glucose measurements for the same individual. The evaluation suggests that the data assimilation forecasts compare well with specific glucose measurements and match or exceed in accuracy expert forecasts. We conclude by examining ways to present predictions as forecast-derived range quantities and evaluate the comparative advantages of these ranges.},

Focus groups demonstrated that individuals rely on simple heuristics and tend to take a reactive approach to their health and nutrition management.

	abstract = {One way to interject knowledge into clinically impactful forecasting is to use data assimilation, a nonlinear regression that projects data onto a mechanistic physiologic model, instead of a set of functions, such as neural networks. Such regressions have an advantage of being useful with particularly sparse, non-stationary clinical data. However, physiological models are often nonlinear and can have many parameters, leading to potential problems with parameter identifiability, or the ability to find a unique set of parameters that minimize forecasting error. The identifiability problems can be minimized or eliminated by reducing the number of parameters estimated, but reducing the number of estimated parameters also reduces the flexibility of the model and hence increases forecasting error. We propose a method, the parameter Houlihan, that combines traditional machine learning techniques with data assimilation, to select the right set of model parameters to minimize forecasting error while reducing identifiability problems. The method worked well: the data assimilation-based glucose forecasts and estimates for our cohort using the Houlihan-selected parameter sets generally also minimize forecasting errors compared to other parameter selection methods such as by-hand parameter selection. Nevertheless, the forecast with the lowest forecast error does not always accurately represent physiology, but further advancements of the algorithm provide a path for improving physiologic fidelity as well. Our hope is that this methodology represents a first step toward combining machine learning with data assimilation and provides a lower-threshold entry point for using data assimilation with clinical data by helping select the right parameters to estimate.},

	abstract = {Decision-making related to health is complex. Machine learning (ML) and patient generated data can identify patterns and insights at the individual level, where human cognition falls short, but not all ML-generated information is of equal utility for making health-related decisions. We develop and apply attributable components analysis (ACA), a method inspired by optimal transport theory, to type 2 diabetes self-monitoring data to identify patterns of association between nutrition and blood glucose control. In comparison with linear regression, we found that ACA offers a number of characteristics that make it promising for use in decision support applications. For example, ACA was able to identify non-linear relationships, was more robust to outliers, and offered broader and more expressive uncertainty estimates. In addition, our results highlight a tradeoff between model accuracy and interpretability, and we discuss implications for ML-driven decision support systems.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14193},
	abstract = {In this paper, we build a new, simple, and interpretable mathematical model to describe the human glucose-insulin system. Our goal is the robust control of the blood-glucose (BG) level of individuals to a desired healthy range, by means of adjusting the amount of nutrition and/or external insulin appropriately. By constructing a simple yet flexible model class, with interpretable parameters, this general model can be specialized to work in different settings, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), intensive care unit (ICU) and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM); different choices of appropriate model functions describing uptake of nutrition and removal of glucose differentiate between the models. In addition to data-driven decision-making and control, we believe the model is also useful for basic quantification of endocrine physiology. In both cases the available data is sparse and collected in clinical settings, major factors that have constrained our model choice to the simple form adopted. The model has the form of a linear stochastic differential equation (SDE) to describe the evolution of the blood glucose (BG) level. The model includes a term quantifying glucose removal from the bloodstream through the regulation system of the human body and/or from externally delivered insulin; it also includes another term representing the effect of nutrition. The stochastic fluctuations encapsulate model error necessitated by simple model form, and enable flexible incorporation of data. The parameters entering the equation must be learned in a patient-specific fashion, leading to personalized models. We present numerical results on patient-specific parameter estimation and future BG level forecasting in T2DM and ICU settings. The resulting model leads to prediction of the BG level as an expected value accompanied by a band around this value which accounts for uncertainties in prediction.},

The highly individual nature of the disease presents a need for each affected person to discover which daily activities have the most positive impact on one’s health and which are detrimental to it. Data collected with self-monitoring can help to reveal these relationships, however interpreting such data may be non-trivial. In this research we investigate how individuals with type 2 diabetes and their healthcare providers reason about data collected with self-monitoring and what computational methods can facilitate this process.},
