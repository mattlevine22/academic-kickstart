Welcome! I am a graduate student in computing and mathematical sciences at Caltech. My work focuses on improving traditional physics-based forecasting of dynamical systems by blending data assimilation and machine learning techniques. The growing trend of physics-aware/informed/guided/agnostic machine learning has created exciting new opportunities in applied mathematics, and I am currently developing a theoretical framework to unify these approaches. In addition, I enjoy applying these methods in impactful contexts---so far, I have worked substantially in the biomedical sciences, and have begun work directed towards climatological applications.

Here is a link to the slides for my talk at SIAM Dynamical Systems 2021:
