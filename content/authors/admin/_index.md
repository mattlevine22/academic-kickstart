Welcome! I am a graduate student in computing and mathematical sciences at Caltech. My work focuses on improving the prediction and inference of physical systems by blending machine learning, mechanistic modeling, and data assimilation techniques. I aim to build robust, unifying theory for these approaches, as well as develop concrete applications. I have worked substantially in the biomedical sciences, and enjoy collaborating on impactful applied projects.
