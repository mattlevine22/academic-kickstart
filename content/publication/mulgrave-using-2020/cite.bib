 abstract = {Motivation: There is a growing need to integrate mechanistic models of biological processes with computational methods in healthcare in order to improve prediction. We apply data assimilation in the context of Type 2 diabetes to understand parameters associated with the disease. Results: The data assimilation method captures how well patients improve glucose tolerance after their surgery. Data assimilation has the potential to improve phenotyping in Type 2 diabetes.},
